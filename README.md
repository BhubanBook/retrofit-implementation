## Does this implementation make sense? Go for best practice...
I created [different-network-layer](https://github.com/hasancse91/retrofit-implementation/tree/different-network-layer) branch in this repository for a better implementation. In `master` branch I called `Retrofit` methods from my `Activity` class. But the network related implementation should in a different **network layer** not in **view layer**. You'll find an abstraction layer in this implementation. Click [**here**](https://github.com/hasancse91/retrofit-implementation/tree/different-network-layer) for full source code.
